## Germany’s Railway Paradox
- Discusing about DB Delays's

Germany is often celebrated as a land of efficiency and punctuality. Yet, one of its greatest challenges lies at the core of its mobility: the national railway system operated by **Deutsche Bahn (DB)**.  

For millions of commuters, DB is both indispensable and frustrating — a love–hate relationship that shapes the rhythm of everyday life. While DB connects workers, families, and entire regions, its persistent delays disrupt schedules, productivity, and even the country’s reputation for timeliness.  

This project explores the story hidden within DB’s delays. By analyzing real-world data, the goal is to uncover trends, highlight problem areas, and provide insights into one of Germany’s most talked-about public issues.
